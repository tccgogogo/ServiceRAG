Many developers searching for an API, may actually be looking for an JavaScript web mapping library. There are a few of these to choose from including free and open source options such as LeafletJS. These work by fetching map \"tiles\" from a tile server, and there are several of these to choose from too (the main OpenStreetMap server is not the only option)Some developers may be looking for data downloads. You can download the entire planet's worth of map data from planet.openstreetmap.org, and keep in syc with community map updates, using the \"diff\" downloads. Or you can download smaller more manageable country-sized, or city-size \"extracts\" of OpenStreetMap data.We do have a thing called the \"OpenStreetMap API\". This provides read and write operations on the raw map data of the OpenStreetMap database. It is actually primarily for OpenStreetMap editing software, and although any developers can create a new editor tool, this is not a small undertaking, and should be carried out with careful consultation with the OpenStreetMap community. In other words... this thing called the \"OpenStreetMap API\" is probably not what you're looking for!You can use the OpenStreetMap API to download small chunks of map data, but for this purpose it's also worth checking out some other options. In particular the OverpassAPI offers some flexible querying by tags etc, which may be useful for your app.Whether you're wrangling raw geo-data or presenting a web-map mashup, the possibilities provided by OpenStreetMap, and by third parties within the OpenStreetMap ecosystem, offer endless potential for geo map hacking fun!

Once a project reaches its funding goal, we deliver the materials to the school.You'll get photos of your project taking place, a thank-you letter from the teacher, and a cost report showing how each dollar was spent. If you give over $100, you'll also receive hand-written thank-you letters from the students.DonorsChoose.org's simple JSON API allows developers to pull DonorsChoose.org classroom project listings into their website or application using project selection criteria of their choosing.The JSON API has been used by DonorsChoose.org partners like Chevron, SONIC Drive-In, NBC Universal, Bing, PayPal, and others to build high-profile highly customized giving and cause marketing experiences.The API also enables developers to donate to projects or purchase gift cards without routing users to DonorsChoose.org for payment.",

Once a project reaches its funding goal, we deliver the materials to the school.You'll get photos of your project taking place, a thank-you letter from the teacher, and a cost report showing how each dollar was spent. If you give over $100, you'll also receive hand-written thank-you letters from the students.DonorsChoose.org's simple JSON API allows developers to pull DonorsChoose.org classroom project listings into their website or application using project selection criteria of their choosing.The JSON API has been used by DonorsChoose.org partners like Chevron, SONIC Drive-In, NBC Universal, Bing, PayPal, and others to build high-profile highly customized giving and cause marketing experiences.The API also enables developers to donate to projects or purchase gift cards without routing users to DonorsChoose.org for payment.",

Many developers searching for an API, may actually be looking for an JavaScript web mapping library. There are a few of these to choose from including free and open source options such as LeafletJS. These work by fetching map \"tiles\" from a tile server, and there are several of these to choose from too (the main OpenStreetMap server is not the only option)Some developers may be looking for data downloads. You can download the entire planet's worth of map data from planet.openstreetmap.org, and keep in syc with community map updates, using the \"diff\" downloads. Or you can download smaller more manageable country-sized, or city-size \"extracts\" of OpenStreetMap data.We do have a thing called the \"OpenStreetMap API\". This provides read and write operations on the raw map data of the OpenStreetMap database. It is actually primarily for OpenStreetMap editing software, and although any developers can create a new editor tool, this is not a small undertaking, and should be carried out with careful consultation with the OpenStreetMap community. In other words... this thing called the \"OpenStreetMap API\" is probably not what you're looking for!You can use the OpenStreetMap API to download small chunks of map data, but for this purpose it's also worth checking out some other options. In particular the OverpassAPI offers some flexible querying by tags etc, which may be useful for your app.Whether you're wrangling raw geo-data or presenting a web-map mashup, the possibilities provided by OpenStreetMap, and by third parties within the OpenStreetMap ecosystem, offer endless potential for geo map hacking fun! If you need help with development, join the osm-dev mailing list, or other OpenStreetMap contact channels",

Voice applications written on Twilio's cloud solution scale transparently, eliminating programming, operational and contractual headaches frequently associated with rapid growth or traffic spikes.\nTwilio provides a cloud API for voice and SMS communications that leverages existing web development skills, resources and infrastructure. It minimizes the learning curve required to build advanced, reliable voice communications applications that solve critical business needs. The syntax and programming model are focused on making application development as close to the request/response model of web application development as possible. The API uses a RESTful interface and responses are formatted in HTML, JSON, XML or CSV.",

Many developers searching for an API, may actually be looking for an JavaScript web mapping library. There are a few of these to choose from including free and open source options such as LeafletJS. These work by fetching map \"tiles\" from a tile server, and there are several of these to choose from too (the main OpenStreetMap server is not the only option)Some developers may be looking for data downloads. You can download the entire planet's worth of map data from planet.openstreetmap.org, and keep in syc with community map updates, using the \"diff\" downloads. Or you can download smaller more manageable country-sized, or city-size \"extracts\" of OpenStreetMap data.We do have a thing called the \"OpenStreetMap API\". This provides read and write operations on the raw map data of the OpenStreetMap database. It is actually primarily for OpenStreetMap editing software, and although any developers can create a new editor tool, this is not a small undertaking, and should be carried out with careful consultation with the OpenStreetMap community. In other words... this thing called the \"OpenStreetMap API\" is probably not what you're looking for!You can use the OpenStreetMap API to download small chunks of map data, but for this purpose it's also worth checking out some other options. In particular the OverpassAPI offers some flexible querying by tags etc, which may be useful for your app.Whether you're wrangling raw geo-data or presenting a web-map mashup, the possibilities provided by OpenStreetMap, and by third parties within the OpenStreetMap ecosystem, offer endless potential for geo map hacking fun!

Clicking on any entry in the table either opens the source document or initiates a new visualization based on the cited or citing application or patent.\nThis mashup is a rudimentary prototype that utilizes 'screen scraping' techniques, implemented in PHP 7, to extract data from Google Patents. The extracted data is then formatted into a timeline that users can engage with directly. It has been tested and is compatible with the Google Chrome browser, requiring JavaScript to function properly. As a screen scraper, there may occasionally be unexpected results, but this method was necessary following Google's discontinuation of its direct API. It utilizes real-time, updated data from Google Patents (both the legacy and current versions). For comments, feedback, or requests for additional features, please click here to contact us.",
