Once a project reaches its funding goal, we deliver the materials to the school.You'll get photos of your project taking place, a thank-you letter from the teacher, and a cost report showing how each dollar was spent. If you give over $100, you'll also receive hand-written thank-you letters from the students.DonorsChoose.org's simple JSON API allows developers to pull DonorsChoose.org classroom project listings into their website or application using project selection criteria of their choosing.The JSON API has been used by DonorsChoose.org partners like Chevron, SONIC Drive-In, NBC Universal, Bing, PayPal, and others to build high-profile highly customized giving and cause marketing experiences.The API also enables developers to donate to projects or purchase gift cards without routing users to DonorsChoose.org for payment.",

The Calendar Data API lets users incorporate Calendar functionality into their own application or website. Users can edit calendars, create and delete events, query for events that match particular criteria, send invitations, and more.\nThere are many possible uses for the Calendar data API. For example, users can create a web front end for a group calendar that uses Google Calendar as a back end. Or a public calendar can be generated for Google Calendar to display, based on a company event database. Or users can search relevant calendars to display a list of upcoming events on those calendars.",

Every few minutes, the system searches the world's newly posted blog entries for occurrences of the phrases \"I feel\" and \"I am feeling\". When it finds such a phrase, it records the full sentence, up to the period, and identifies the \"feeling\" expressed in that sentence (e.g. sad, happy, depressed, etc.). The result is a database of several million human feelings, increasing by 15,000 - 20,000 new feelings per day.",

Ask for that word or name, and another user will pronounce it for you. You can also help others by recording your pronunciations in your own language.\nCurrently the API allows users to read or listen to word pronounciations with future functionality to include search, languages and standard pronounciations. Possible uses include adding pronunciations for your dictionary or creating a better Google Translate with real human pronunciations.

Many developers searching for an API, may actually be looking for an JavaScript web mapping library. There are a few of these to choose from including free and open source options such as LeafletJS. These work by fetching map \"tiles\" from a tile server, and there are several of these to choose from too (the main OpenStreetMap server is not the only option)Some developers may be looking for data downloads. You can download the entire planet's worth of map data from planet.openstreetmap.org, and keep in syc with community map updates, using the \"diff\" downloads. Or you can download smaller more manageable country-sized, or city-size \"extracts\" of OpenStreetMap data.We do have a thing called the \"OpenStreetMap API\". This provides read and write operations on the raw map data of the OpenStreetMap database. It is actually primarily for OpenStreetMap editing software, and although any developers can create a new editor tool, this is not a small undertaking, and should be carried out with careful consultation with the OpenStreetMap community. In other words... this thing called the \"OpenStreetMap API\" is probably not what you're looking for!You can use the OpenStreetMap API to download small chunks of map data, but for this purpose it's also worth checking out some other options. In particular the OverpassAPI offers some flexible querying by tags etc, which may be useful for your app.Whether you're wrangling raw geo-data or presenting a web-map mashup, the possibilities provided by OpenStreetMap, and by third parties within the OpenStreetMap ecosystem, offer endless potential for geo map hacking fun!

Once a project reaches its funding goal, we deliver the materials to the school.You'll get photos of your project taking place, a thank-you letter from the teacher, and a cost report showing how each dollar was spent. If you give over $100, you'll also receive hand-written thank-you letters from the students.DonorsChoose.org's simple JSON API allows developers to pull DonorsChoose.org classroom project listings into their website or application using project selection criteria of their choosing.The JSON API has been used by DonorsChoose.org partners like Chevron, SONIC Drive-In, NBC Universal, Bing, PayPal, and others to build high-profile highly customized giving and cause marketing experiences.The API also enables developers to donate to projects or purchase gift cards without routing users to DonorsChoose.org for payment.",

Once a project reaches its funding goal, we deliver the materials to the school.You'll get photos of your project taking place, a thank-you letter from the teacher, and a cost report showing how each dollar was spent. If you give over $100, you'll also receive hand-written thank-you letters from the students.DonorsChoose.org's simple JSON API allows developers to pull DonorsChoose.org classroom project listings into their website or application using project selection criteria of their choosing.The JSON API has been used by DonorsChoose.org partners like Chevron, SONIC Drive-In, NBC Universal, Bing, PayPal, and others to build high-profile highly customized giving and cause marketing experiences.The API also enables developers to donate to projects or purchase gift cards without routing users to DonorsChoose.org for payment.",

Many developers searching for an API, may actually be looking for an JavaScript web mapping library. There are a few of these to choose from including free and open source options such as LeafletJS. These work by fetching map \"tiles\" from a tile server, and there are several of these to choose from too (the main OpenStreetMap server is not the only option)Some developers may be looking for data downloads. You can download the entire planet's worth of map data from planet.openstreetmap.org, and keep in syc with community map updates, using the \"diff\" downloads. Or you can download smaller more manageable country-sized, or city-size \"extracts\" of OpenStreetMap data.We do have a thing called the \"OpenStreetMap API\". This provides read and write operations on the raw map data of the OpenStreetMap database. It is actually primarily for OpenStreetMap editing software, and although any developers can create a new editor tool, this is not a small undertaking, and should be carried out with careful consultation with the OpenStreetMap community. In other words... this thing called the \"OpenStreetMap API\" is probably not what you're looking for!You can use the OpenStreetMap API to download small chunks of map data, but for this purpose it's also worth checking out some other options. In particular the OverpassAPI offers some flexible querying by tags etc, which may be useful for your app.Whether you're wrangling raw geo-data or presenting a web-map mashup, the possibilities provided by OpenStreetMap, and by third parties within the OpenStreetMap ecosystem, offer endless potential for geo map hacking fun! If you need help with development, join the osm-dev mailing list, or other OpenStreetMap contact channels",

        "description": "This hack was created at [MoDevEast in Washington DC](http://blog.mashery.com/content/awesome-dc-hackathon-usa-today-hq-modeveast). It was designed to be a proof of concept of how you can use the fact that Siri can send emails along with [SendGrid's Parse API](http://docs.sendgrid.com/documentation/api/parse-api-2/) to create your own custom Siri API.\nWhen you are done with this tutorial, you will be able to ask Siri to motivate you and Siri will oblidge by calling you via Twilio to tell you \"You are Awesome.\" :)\nI hope that you take this concept to the next level and dream up interesting things for Siri to do. At the [SendGrid Mobile Hackday](http://sendgridmh.eventbrite.com/) a few developers asked Siri to check them into Foursquare, post to Twitter and remotely launch apps on their Macs.",

Many developers searching for an API, may actually be looking for an JavaScript web mapping library. There are a few of these to choose from including free and open source options such as LeafletJS. These work by fetching map \"tiles\" from a tile server, and there are several of these to choose from too (the main OpenStreetMap server is not the only option)Some developers may be looking for data downloads. You can download the entire planet's worth of map data from planet.openstreetmap.org, and keep in syc with community map updates, using the \"diff\" downloads. Or you can download smaller more manageable country-sized, or city-size \"extracts\" of OpenStreetMap data.We do have a thing called the \"OpenStreetMap API\". This provides read and write operations on the raw map data of the OpenStreetMap database. It is actually primarily for OpenStreetMap editing software, and although any developers can create a new editor tool, this is not a small undertaking, and should be carried out with careful consultation with the OpenStreetMap community. In other words... this thing called the \"OpenStreetMap API\" is probably not what you're looking for!You can use the OpenStreetMap API to download small chunks of map data, but for this purpose it's also worth checking out some other options. In particular the OverpassAPI offers some flexible querying by tags etc, which may be useful for your app.Whether you're wrangling raw geo-data or presenting a web-map mashup, the possibilities provided by OpenStreetMap, and by third parties within the OpenStreetMap ecosystem, offer endless potential for geo map hacking fun!

It then formats the data about patents and patent applications it cites or other that cite this patent or application on a timeline that can be interacted with. It has been tested with the Google Chrome browser and requires JavaScript to be allowed to run.

Once a project reaches its funding goal, we deliver the materials to the school.You'll get photos of your project taking place, a thank-you letter from the teacher, and a cost report showing how each dollar was spent. If you give over $100, you'll also receive hand-written thank-you letters from the students.DonorsChoose.org's simple JSON API allows developers to pull DonorsChoose.org classroom project listings into their website or application using project selection criteria of their choosing.The JSON API has been used by DonorsChoose.org partners like Chevron, SONIC Drive-In, NBC Universal, Bing, PayPal, and others to build high-profile highly customized giving and cause marketing experiences.The API also enables developers to donate to projects or purchase gift cards without routing users to DonorsChoose.org for payment.",
