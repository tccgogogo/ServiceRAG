<Background> 
Service recommendation refers to analyzing and recommending appropriate services or functionalities based on user needs or a specific application scenario. These services are typically provided in the form of APIs (Application Programming Interfaces). Your task, as a Mashup developer, is to analyze the Mashup's description, identify its functional requirements, and select a combination of APIs from the provided related_apis.

Example mashups and their associated APIs are as follows:
{
    "title": "Mashup: Development with WizIQ Virtual Classroom API",
    "tags": [],
    "description": "We do with WizIQ Virtual Classroom API:\nIntegration with WizIQ Virtual Classroom API\nCustom Software development with WizIQ Virtual Classroom API\nMobile Application development with WizIQ Virtual Classroom API\nSupport, Maintenance & Migration for WizIQ Virtual Classroom API",
    "related_apis": [
        {
            "title": "WizIQ Virtual Classroom API MASTER RECORD",
            "tags": [

                "Training"
            ],
            "description": "WizIQ offers a rich set of intuitive tools for online teaching including virtual classroom, student recruitment tools, and payment collection mechanisms. Developers can use the WizIQ API to integrate WizIQ with their website, CMS or Learning Management System. Functionality exposed by the API includes conducting live classes to multiple users, taking attendance, uploading and managing content and more. The API uses RESTful calls and responses are formatted in XML.",

<Your Task>
To ensure accurate recommendations, follow these steps to think step by step:
1. Analyze Functional Requirements: Carefully read the Mashup description and extract the key functional needs.
2. Filter APIs: Review the description and tags of each API in related_apis to determine if it fulfills the extracted functional requirements. Select only APIs that meet the needs.
3. Retrieve Titles: For each matching API, extract its title field and include it in the final output.Only select titles from the provided related_apis list. Do not create or modify any titles.
4. Ensure Coverage: Verify that the selected APIs comprehensively cover all the Mashup's functional requirements. Combine multiple APIs if necessary.
5. Return 10 APIs: The output list of APIs must always contain exactly 10 entries. 

<Output Requirements You Must Follow>
You must output in JSON format, and the JSON output must strictly contain only the mashup and related_apis fields, as shown in the example. The value of mashup must exactly match the description provided in the input.
The related_apis list must always contain exactly 10 items. Only select APIs from the provided related_apis list, and output only the titles of these APIs to form the list, such as ["API Title 1", "API Title 2", "xxx"].
Only select titles from the provided related_apis list. Do not create or modify any titles.
Avoid any extra comments or unnecessary text in the output. Do not output in markdown.
Double-check that all elements in the related_apis list of your output are valid title entries from the input.Do not arbitrarily modify or shorten the content of the title name, and absolutely do not fabricate or invent any content.
